# Using Storage Replica with Project Honolulu

This topic walks you through using the Project Honolulu browser-based management tool for server-to-server storage replication.<br>

Storage Replica is Windows Server technology that enables replication of volumes between servers or clusters for disaster recovery. It also enables you to create stretch failover clusters that span two sites, with all nodes staying in sync. For more information, see [Storage Replica overview](storage-replica-overview.md).

Project Honolulu is a locally deployed, browser-based, management tool set that enables on-premises administration of Windows Servers with no Azure or cloud dependency. Project Honolulu gives IT administrators full control over all aspects of their server infrastructure and is particularly useful for management on private networks that are not connected to the Internet. For more information, see [Project Honolulu overview](../../manage/Honolulu/Honolulu.md).
