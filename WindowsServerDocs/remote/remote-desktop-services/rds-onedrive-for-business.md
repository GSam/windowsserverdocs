# OneDrive for Business and VDI environments 

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

For information about using OneDrive for Business in virtualized environments, including Remote Desktop Services, check out the "Windows specific restrictions and limitations" information in [Restrictions and limitations when you sync files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3125202/restrictions-and-limitations-when-you-sync-files-and-folders).

The OneDrive for Business sync app isnâ€™t supported for client sessions that are hosted on Windows 2008 Terminal Services or Windows 2012 Remote Desktop Services (RDS). This includes both persistent and non-persistent Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).

For the OneDrive for Business sync app to work as designed, the following requirements must be met: 

- The application must be installed on the local computer.
- The user must be able to write to the user profile.
- Data that's written to the user profile must be saved to the local hard disk and be available without a network connection.

Currently we recommend that OneDrive customers in these environments leverage our OneDrive Office 365 web portal or download our OneDrive [UWP app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/onedrive/9wzdncrfj1p3) (Universal Windows Platform) found in the Microsoft Store.
