DirectAccess to Always On VPN migration deployment
==================================================

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows 10

Before starting the migration process from DirectAccess to Always On VPN, be sure you have done the following:

-   Divided the migration effort into multiple phases.

-   Reviewed the feature similarities and difference of DirectAccess and Always On VPN.

-   Evaluated the new and improved features of Always On VPN.

Migrating from DirectAccess to Always On VPN requires a specific process to migrate clients, which helps minimize race conditions that arise from performing migration steps out of order. At a high level, the deployment process consists of these four primary steps:

1.  **Deploy a side-by-side VPN infrastructure.** After you have determined your migration phases and the features you want to include in your deployment, you will deploy the VPN infrastructure side by side with the existing DirectAccess infrastructure. For instructions on deploying the VPN infrastructure, refer to the [Always On VPN Deployment Guide)](../vpn/vpn-top.md).

2.  **Deploy certificates and VPN configuration script to the clients.** After the VPN infrastructure is ready, you will create and publish the required certificates to the client. When the clients have received the certificates, you will deploy the VPN_Profile.ps1 configuration script. Alternatively, you can use Intune to configure the VPN client. Use Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager or Microsoft Intune to monitor for successful VPN configuration deployments.
<!-- maybe put the "remove and decommission" information in a separate markdown document -->
3.  **Remove devices from the DirectAccess security group.** As users migrate successfully, you will remove their devices from the DirectAccess security group before you remove DirectAccess from your environment. Use Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager or Microsoft Intune to determine device-assignment information and discover which device belongs to each user.

4.  **Decommission the DirectAccess infrastructure.** After you have successfully migrated all clients to Always On VPN, you will remove DirectAccess from your environment.

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>This section is NOT a step-by-step deployment guide for Always On VPN but rather is intended to complement [Remote Access Always On VPN Deployment Guide for Windows Server and Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/always-on-vpn/deploy/always-on-vpn-deploy) and provide migration-specific deployment guidance.

Deploy a side-by-side VPN infrastructure
----------------------------------------

You will be deploying the VPN infrastructure side by side with the existing DirectAccess infrastructure, so follow the instructions in [Remote Access Always On VPN Deployment Guide for Windows Server and Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/always-on-vpn/deploy/always-on-vpn-deploy) to install and configure the Always On VPN infrastructure. Side-by-side deployment consists of the following high-level tasks:

1.  Create the VPN Users, VPN Servers, and NPS Servers groups.

2.  Create and publish the necessary certificate templates.

3.  Enroll the server certificates.

4.  Install and configure Remote Access Service for Always On VPN.

5.  Install and configure NPS.

6.  Configure DNS and firewall rules for Always On VPN.

The following image provides a visual reference for the infrastructure changes throughout the DirectAccess-to–Always On VPN migration.

Deploy certificates and VPN configuration script to the clients
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can find the bulk of the VPN client configuration documentation in [Remote Access Always On VPN Deployment Guide for Windows Server and Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/always-on-vpn/deploy/always-on-vpn-deploy). Although most steps in this section reference the Always On VPN deployment guide, two additional steps are needed to complete the migration from DirectAccess to Always On VPN successfully. 

You must ensure that the **VPN_Profile.ps1** comes _after_ the certificate has been issued so that the VPN client does not attempt to connect without it. To do that, you execute a script that adds only those users who have enrolled in the certificate to your VPN Deployment Ready group, which you use to deploy the Always On VPN configuration.

>[!NOTE] 
>Microsoft recommends that you test this process before performing it on any of your user migration rings.

1.  **Create and publish the VPN certificate, and enable the auto-enrollment Group Policy object (GPO).** For traditional,  certificate-based Windows 10 VPN deployments, a certificate is issued to either the device or the user so that it can authenticate the connection. When the new authentication certificate is created and published for auto-enrollment, you must create and deploy a GPO with the auto-enrollment setting configured to the VPN Users group. For the steps to configure certificates and auto-enrollment, see [Remote Access Always On VPN Deployment Guide for Windows Server and Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/always-on-vpn/deploy/always-on-vpn-deploy).

2.  **Add users to the VPN Users group.** Add whichever users you migrate to the VPN Users group. Those users stay in that security group after you have migrated them so that they can receive any certificate updates in the future. Continue to add users to this group until you have moved every user from DirectAccess to Always On VPN.

3.  **Identify users who have received a VPN authentication certificate.** You are migrating from DirectAccess, so you will need to add a method for identifying when a client has received the required certificate and is ready to receive the VPN configuration information. Run the **GetUsersWithCert.ps1** script to add users who are currently issued nonrevoked certificates originating from the specified template name to a specified AD DS security group. For example, after running the **GetUsersWithCert.ps1** script, any user issued a valid  certificate from the VPN Authentication Certificate template is added to the VPN Deployment Ready group.

    >[!NOTE] 
    >If you do not have a method to identify when a client has received the required certificate, you could deploy the VPN configuration before the certificate has been issued to the user, causing the VPN connection to fail. To avoid this situation, run the **GetUsersWithCert.ps1** script on the certification authority or on a schedule to synchronize users who have received the certificate to the VPN Deployment Ready group. You will then use that security group to target your VPN configuration deployment in System Center Configuration Manager or Intune, which ensures that the managed client does not receive the VPN configuration before it has received the certificate.
    
    ### GetUsersWithCert.ps1
    
    ```powershell
    Import-module ActiveDirectory
    Import-Module AdcsAdministration
    
    $TemplateName = 'VPNUserAuthentication'##Certificate Template Name (not the friendly name)
    $GroupName = 'VPN Deployment Ready' ##Group you will add the users to
    $CSServerName = 'localhost\corp-dc-ca' ##CA Server Information
    
    $users= @()
    $TemplateID = (get-CATemplate | Where-Object {$_.Name -like $TemplateName} | Select-Object oid).oid
    $View = New-Object -ComObject CertificateAuthority.View
    $NULL = $View.OpenConnection($CSServerName)
    $View.SetResultColumnCount(3)
    $i1 = $View.GetColumnIndex($false, "User Principal Name")
    $i2 = $View.GetColumnIndex($false, "Certificate Template")
    $i3 = $View.GetColumnIndex($false, "Revocation Date")
    $i1, $i2, $i3 | %{$View.SetResultColumn($_) }
    $Row= $View.OpenView()
    
    while ($Row.Next() -ne -1){
    $Cert = New-Object PsObject
    $Col = $Row.EnumCertViewColumn()
    [void]$Col.Next()
    do {
    $Cert | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty $($Col.GetDisplayName()) -Value $($Col.GetValue(1)) -Force
          }
    until ($Col.Next() -eq -1)
    $col = ''
    
    if($cert."Certificate Template" -eq $TemplateID -and $cert."Revocation Date" -eq $NULL){
       $users= $users+= $cert."User Principal Name"
    $temp = $cert."User Principal Name"
    $user = get-aduser -Filter {UserPrincipalName -eq $temp} –Property UserPrincipalName
    Add-ADGroupMember $GroupName $user
       }
      }
    ```

4. Deploy the Always On VPN configuration. As the VPN authentication certificates are issued, and you run the **GetUsersWithCert.ps1** script, the users are added to the VPN Deployment Ready security group.


| If you are using...  | Then... |
| ---- | ---- |
| System Center Configuration Manager | Create a user collection based on that security group's membership.<br><br>![](../../media/DA-to-AlwaysOnVPN/b38723b3ffcfacd697b83dd41a177f66.png)!|
| Intune | Simply target the security group directly once it is synchronized. |
|
    
Each time you run the GetUsersWithCert.ps1 configuration script, you must also run an AD DS discovery rule to update the security group membership in System Center Configuration Manager. Also, ensure that the membership update for the deployment collection frequently occurs enough (aligned with the script and discovery rule).

For additional information about using System Center Configuration Manager or Intune to deploy Always On VPN to Windows clients, see [Remote Access Always On VPN Deployment Guide for Windows Server and Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/always-on-vpn/deploy/always-on-vpn-deploy). Be sure, however, to incorporate these migration-specific tasks.

>[!NOTE] 
>Incorporating these migration-specific tasks is a critical difference between a simple Always On VPN deployment and migration from DirectAccess to Always On VPN. Be sure to properly define the collection to target the security group rather than using the method in the deployment guide.

<!-- pashort 2/17/2018: think about moving the "remove and decommission" information to a separate markdown document -->
Remove devices from the DirectAccess security group
---------------------------------------------------

As users receive the authentication certificate and the **VPN_Profile.ps1** configuration script, you see corresponding successful VPN configuration script deployments in either System Center Configuration Manager or Intune. After each deployment, remove that user's device from the DirectAccess security group so that you can later remove DirectAccess. Both Intune and System Center Configuration Manager contains user device assignment information to help you determine each user's device.

>[!NOTE] 
>If you are applying DirectAccess GPOs through organizational units (OUs) rather than computer groups, move the user's computer object out of the OU.

Decommission the DirectAccess infrastructure
--------------------------------------------

When you have finished migrating all your DirectAccess clients to Always On VPN, you can decommission the DirectAccess infrastructure and remove the DirectAccess settings from Group Policy. Microsoft recommends performing the following steps to remove DirectAccess from your environment gracefully:

1.  **Remove the configuration settings.** Remove the GPOs and the Remote Access Group policy settings Remote Access created by opening the Remote Access Management console and selecting Remove Configuration Settings, as shown in the image below. If you remove the group before you remove the configuration, you will likely get errors.

    ![](../../media/DA-to-AlwaysOnVPN/dbdc3d80e8dc1b8665f7b15d7d2ee1f6.png)

1.  **Remove the DirectAccess security group.** When you have completed the process in this guide, the DirectAccess security group should be empty. As the deployment of Always On VPN continues, remove devices for each user from the DirectAccess security group so that you can remove DirectAccess from your environment. **Do not** remove the security group if it still contains members. If you do remove the security group with members in it, you risk leaving employees without remote access from their devices.

2.  **Clean up DNS.** Be sure to remove any records from your internal DNS server and public DNS server related to DirectAccess, for example, DA.contoso.com, DAGateway.contoso.com.

3.  **Decommission the DirectAccess server.** When you have successfully removed the configuration settings and DNS records, you are ready to tear down the DirectAccess server. To do so, either remove the role in Server Manager or decommission the server and remove it from AD DS.

4.  **Remove any DirectAccess certificates from Active Directory Certificate Services.** If you used computer certificates for your DirectAccess implementation, remove the published templates from the Certificate Templates folder in the Certification Authority console.
