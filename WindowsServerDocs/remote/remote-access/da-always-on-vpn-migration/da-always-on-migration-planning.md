DirectAccess to Always On VPN migration planning
================================================

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows 10

Migrating from DirectAccess to Always On VPN requires proper planning to determine your migration phases, which helps identify any issues before they affect the entire organization. The primary goal of the migration is for users to maintain remote connectivity to the office throughout the process. If you perform tasks out of order, a race condition may occur, leaving remote users with no way to access company resources. Therefore, Microsoft recommends performing a planned, side-by-side migration from DirectAccess to Always On VPN. For details, see the [Always On VPN migration deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-access/da-always-on-vpn-migration/da-always-on-migration-deploy) section.

The section describes feature similarities and difference between DirectAccess and Always On VPN, benefits of separating users for the migration, standard configuration considerations, and Always On VPN feature enhancements. The migration planning phase includes:

1.  **Building migration rings.** As in most other system migrations, target client migrations in phases to help identify any issues before they affect the entire organization. The first part of Always On VPN migration is no different.

2.  **Reviewing the feature mapping between DirectAccess and Always On VPN.** Similar to DirectAccess, Always On VPN has many security, connectivity, authentication, and other options.

3.  **Reviewing the new features of Always On VPN.** Discover new or improved features that Always On VPN offers to improve your configuration.

## Build migration rings
Migration rings are used to divide the Always On VPN client migration effort into multiple phases. By the time you get to the last phase, your process should be well tested and consistent.

This section provides one approach for separating users into migration phases, and then managing those phases. Regardless of the user phase separation method you choose, maintain a single VPN Users group for easier management when the migration is complete.

>[!NOTE] 
>The word _phase_ is not intended to indicate that this is a long process. Whether you move through each phase in a couple of days or a couple of months, Microsoft recommends that you take advantage of side-by-side migration and use a phased approach.

### Benefits of dividing the migration effort into multiple phases

-   **Mass outage protection.** By dividing a migration into phases, the number of people a migration-generated issue can affect is much smaller.

-   **Improvement in process or communication from feedback.** Ideally, users did not even notice that the migration occurred. However, if their experience was less than optimal, feedback from those uses gives you an opportunity to improve your planning and avoid issues in the future.

### Tips for building your migration ring

-   **Identify remote users.** Start by separating users into two buckets: those who frequently come into the office and those who do not. The migration process is the same for both groups, but it is likely to take longer for the remote clients to receive the update than for those who connect more frequently. Each migration phase, ideally, should include members from each bucket.

-  **Prioritize users.** Leadership and other high-impact users are typically among the last users migrated. When prioritizing users, however, consider their business productivity impact if migration of their client computer were to fail. For example, if you had a rating of 1 to 3, with 1 meaning that the employee would not be able to work and 3 meaning no immediate work interruption, a business analyst using only internal line-of-business (LOB) apps remotely would be a 1, whereas a salesperson using a cloud app would be a 3.

-   **Migrate each department or business unit in multiple phases.** Microsoft strongly recommends that you do not migrate an entire department at the same time. If an issue should arise, you do not want it to hinder remote work for the whole department. Instead, migrate each department or business unit in at least two phases.

-   **Gradually increase user counts.** Most typical migration scenarios start with members of the IT organization and then move to business users followed by leadership and other high-impact users. Each migration phase typically involves progressively more people. For example, the first phase may include ten users, and the final group may include 5,000 users. To simplify the deployment, create a single VPN Users security group, and add users to it as their phase arrives. In this way, you end up with a single VPN Users group to which you can add members in the future.

## Standard configuration considerations

Always ON VPN has many configuration options. When migrating from DirectAccess to Always On VPN, however, consider starting with  configuration options that are comparable to what you have, and then expand from there. However you choose your VPN configuration, though, include the following information:

-   **Connection type.** Connection protocol selection is important and ultimately goes hand in hand with the type of authentication you will use. For details about the tunneling protocols available, see [VPN connection types](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/access-protection/vpn/vpn-connection-type).

-   **Routing.** In this context, routing rules determine whether users can use other network routes while connected to the VPN.

    -   _Split tunneling_ allows simultaneous access to other networks, such as the Internet.

    -   _Force tunneling_ requires all traffic to go exclusively through the VPN and does not allow simultaneous access to other networks.

-   **Triggering.** _Triggering_ determines how and when a VPN connection is initiated (for example, when an app opens, when the device is turned on, manually by the user). For triggering options, see the [VPN connectivity](#vpn-connectivity).

-   **Device or user authentication.** DirectAccess uses machine certificates to enable devices to initiate the remote connection. This approach results in persistent remote network connectivity, with no user action required. Always On VPN can also use device certificates and device-initiated connection through a feature called [Device Tunnel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/vpn-device-tunnel-config). That connection can be initiated automatically and is persistent, resembling a DirectAccess infrastructure tunnel connection.

By using user certificates, the Always On VPN client connects automatically, but it does so at the user level (after user sign-in) instead of at the device level (before user sign-in). The experience is still seamless to the user, but it supports more advanced authentication mechanisms, like Windows Hello for Business.

## <a name="feature-mapping"></a>Feature mapping between DirectAccess and Always On VPN

This section covers feature similarities and differences between DirectAccess and Always On VPN. This list is not exhaustive, but it does include some of the most common features and functions of DirectAccess. The features and scenarios discussed fall into three categories:

-   **Equivalent functionality.** These are scenarios and features used in DirectAccess that have a directly related capability in Always On VPN. Where possible, this guide provides the configuration service provider (CSP) parameter for configuring each option so that you're aware of the XML setting name.

-   **Improved functionality.** These are situations or scenarios in which Always On VPN provides improved functionality over DirectAccess or fills a gap in functionality. Where possible, this guide provides the CSP parameter for configuring each option so that you're aware of the XML setting name.

-   **Limited comparable functionality.** In a few situations, Always On VPN requires an alternate way to incorporate existing functionality. This section discusses those changes and how you can gain the functionality with Always On VPN.

For additional details about the feature comparison between DirectAccess and Always On VPN, see [Always On VPN and DirectAccess Features Comparison](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/vpn-map-da).

### Equivalent functionality

Each item in this section is a use case scenario or commonly used DirectAccess feature for which Always On VPN has an equivalent.

| DirectAccess functionality | Always On VPN equivalent |
| ---- | ---- |
| Seamless, transparent connectivity to the corporate network. | You can configure Always On VPN to support auto-triggering based on application launch or namespace resolution requests; you can also set it for permanent connection through Always On VPN.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameters:<br><br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/AlwaysOn`<br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/AppTriggerList`<br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/DomainNameInformationList/AutoTrigger` |
| Use of a dedicated Infrastructure Tunnel to provide connectivity to the corporate network when the user is not signed in. | You can achieve this functionality by using the Device Tunnel feature in the VPN profile.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameter:<br><br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/DeviceTunnel` |
| Use of manage-out to allow remote connectivity to DirectAccess-connected clients from management clients located on the corporate network. | You can achieve this functionality by using the Device Tunnel feature in the VPN profile combined with configuring the VPN connection to dynamically register the IP addresses assigned to the VPN interface with internal DNS services.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameter:<br><br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/DeviceTunnel VPNv2/ProfileName/RegisterDNS` |
| Fall back to IP-HTTPS when DirectAccess clients are behind firewalls or proxy servers. | You can configure to fall back to SSTP (from IKEv2) by using the automatic tunnel/protocol type within the VPN profile.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameter:<br><br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/NativeProfile/NativeProtocolType` |
| Support for DirectAccess end-to-edge access mode. | Always On VPN provides connectivity to corporate resources by using tunnel policies that require authentication and encryption until they reach the VPN gateway. By default, the tunnel sessions terminate at the VPN gateway, which also functions as the IKEv2 gateway, providing end-to-edge security. |
| Support for limited access to specific application servers using DirectAccess end-to-end access mode. | DirectAccess provides the ability to extend end-to-edge IPsec policies all the way to specified application servers. You can configure similar capability in Always On VPN by using an IPsec transport policy tunneled inside the end-to-edge VPN tunnel. The VPN gateway then forwards the authenticated and traffic-protected IPsec sessions to the application servers. Also, you can employ traffic filters to limit connectivity to specific destinations across the Always On VPN connection, providing end-to-end security to specific servers. |
| Support for load balancing using Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB) or external load balancers. | Always On VPN supports the use of integrated Windows NLB or third-party hardware load-balancing solutions to provide VPN load-balancing capabilities. Both IKEv2 and SSTP tunnel types/protocols can be successfully load balanced. |
| Support for machine certificate authentication. | The IKEv2 protocol type available as part of the Always On VPN platform specifically supports the use of authentication by machine or computer certificates for VPN authentication.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameter:<br><br> `VPNv2/ProfileName/NativeProfile/Authentication/MachineMethod` |
| Use DirectAccess security groups to limit remote access functionality to specific clients. | You can configure Always On VPN to support granular authorization when using RADIUS, which includes the use of security groups to control VPN access. |
| Support for DirectAccess servers behind an edge firewall or NAT device. | Always On VPN gives you the ability to use protocols like IKEv2 and SSTP that fully support the use of a VPN gateway that is behind a NAT device or edge firewall. |
| Use of NLS to determine intranet connectivity when connected to the corporate network. | Trusted network detection provides a similar capability to DirectAccess NLS for detecting corporate network connections, but it is based on an assessment of the connection-specific DNS suffix assigned to network interfaces and network profile rather than depending on a web service probe mechanism and associated internal web server infrastructure to function.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameter:<br><br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/TrustedNetworkDetection` |
| DirectAccess compliance using Network Access Protection (NAP). | The Always On VPN client can integrate with Azure conditional access to enforce MFA, device compliance, or a combination of both. When compliant with conditional access policies, Azure AD issues a short-lived (by default, 60 minutes) IPsec authentication certificate that the client can then use to authenticate to the VPN gateway. Device compliance takes advantage of System Center Configuration Manager/Intune compliance policies, which can include the device health attestation state. At this time, Azure VPN conditional access provides the closest replacement to the existing NAP solution, although there is no form of remediation service or quarantine network capabilities.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameter:<br><br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/DeviceCompliance` |
| Ability to define which management servers are accessible before user sign-in. | You can achieve this functionality in Always On VPN by using the Device Tunnel feature (available in version 1709) in the VPN profile combined with traffic filters to control which management systems on the corporate network are accessible through the Device Tunnel.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameters:<br><br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/DeviceTunnel`<br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/TrafficFilterList` |
| Monitoring of DirectAccess operational status. | Although not strictly specific to Always On VPN, the Windows Server 2016 Remote Access Management console natively provides the operational status of VPN services. |
| Monitoring of DirectAccess remote access client status. | Although not strictly specific to the Always On VPN, the Windows Server 2016 Remote Access Management console natively provides the connection status of Always On VPN clients.  |
| Use of Inbox or RADIUS accounting for reporting of DirectAccess connections. | Although not strictly specific to Always On VPN, the Windows Server 2016 Remote Access Management console natively provides reporting for Always On VPN clients. |

### Improved functionality

Each item in this section is a use case scenario or commonly used DirectAccess function for which Always On VPN has improved functionality—either through an expansion of functionality or elimination of a previous limitation.

| DirectAccess functionality | Always On VPN equivalent |
| ---- | ---- |
| Domain-joined devices with Enterprise SKUs requirement. | Always On VPN supports domain-joined, nondomain-joined (workgroup), or Azure AD–joined devices to allow for both enterprise and BYOD scenarios. Always On VPN is available in all Windows editions, and the platform features are available to third parties by way of UWP VPN plug-in support. |
| DirectAccess clients depend on IPv6 and associated IPv6 translation services to function. | With Always On VPN, users can access both IPv4 and IPv6 resources on the corporate network. The Always On VPN client uses a dual-stack approach that doesn't specifically depend on IPv6 or the need for the VPN gateway to provide NAT64 or DNS64 translation services. |
| Support for two-factor or OTP authentication. | The Always On VPN platform natively supports EAP, which allows for the use of diverse Microsoft and third-party EAP types as part of the authentication workflow. Always On VPN specifically supports smart card (both physical and virtual) and Windows Hello for Business certificates to satisfy two-factor authentication requirements. Also, Always On VPN supports OTP and MFA by way of EAP RADIUS integration.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameter:<br><br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/NativeProfile/Authentication` |
| Support for multiple domains and forests. | The Always On VPN platform has no dependency on Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forests or domain topology (or associated functional/schema levels) because it doesn't require the VPN client to be domain joined to function. Group Policy is therefore not a dependency to define VPN profile settings because you do not use it during client configuration. Where Active Directory authorization integration is required, you can achieve it through RADIUS as part of the EAP authentication and authorization process. |
| Support for both split and force tunnel for internet/intranet traffic separation. | You can configure Always On VPN to support both force tunnel (the default operating mode) and split tunnel natively. Always On VPN provides additional granularity for application-specific routing policies.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameters:<br><br> `VPNv2/ProfileName/NativeProfile/RoutingPolicyType`<br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/TrafficFilterList/App/RoutingPolicyType` |
| Support for IP-HTTPS transition technology. | Always On VPN does not require the use of an IPv6 encapsulation protocol like IP-HTTPS. You can configure it to support SSTP natively if Secure Sockets Layer fallback from IKEv2 is required. |
| Support for the DirectAccess Connectivity Assistant to provide corporate connectivity status. | Always On VPN is fully integrated with the native Network Connectivity Assistant and provides connectivity status from the View All Networks interface. With the advent of Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1703), VPN connection status and VPN connection control are now available through the Network flyout, as well. |
| Name resolution of corporate resources using short-name, fully qualified domain name (FQDN), and DNS suffix. | Always On VPN can natively define one or more DNS suffixes as part of the VPN connection and IP address assignment process, including corporate resource name resolution for short names, FQDNs, or entire DNS namespaces. Always On VPN also supports use of Name Resolution Policy Tables to provide namespace-specific resolution granularity.<br><br>Define this functionality by using the following VPNv2 CSP parameters:<br><br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/DnsSuffix`<br>`VPNv2/ProfileName/DomainNameInformationList` |

### Limited comparable functionality

Each item in this section is a use case scenario or commonly used DirectAccess function for which Always On VPN does not have an equivalent natively. Although these are limited functionalities for Always On VPN, you can implement these functionalities in other ways as mentioned in the table below.

| DirectAccess functionality | Always On VPN equivalent |
| ---- | ---- |
| Use of multisite to provide multiple remote access entry points and geo-redundancy. | <!-- pashort 2/15/2018: eventually re-write this column for the two; let's make some sense out of these to prevent user confusion --> No native multisite-equivalent feature exists in Always On VPN without the use of third-party networking equipment or services such as Azure Traffic Manager or a third-party global server load balancer. However, users can manually select an appropriate VPN endpoint if you define multiple entries in the VPN profile. Third-Party UWP VPN plug-ins may support similar features for connecting to the nearest or most appropriate server VPN endpoint, but this varies by provider. |
| Deployment of client and server configuration settings through Group Policy. | Always On VPN does not require devices to be domain joined, so there are no dedicated Group Policy settings to configure it. Instead, you can configure clients by using Windows PowerShell, System Center Configuration Manager, Intune (or a third-party MDM provider), or Windows Configuration Designer. Also, because there's no dependency on a Microsoft VPN gateway, you must configure and manage server settings independent of the Always On VPN. |

##<a name="always-on-vpn-enhancements"></a> Always On VPN enhancements

Always On VPN has many benefits over the Windows VPN solutions of the past. Key improvements in integration, security, connectivity, networking control, and compatibility align Always On VPN with Microsoft's cloud-first, mobile-first vision.

Because many of the devices that require remote access are personal devices, Always On VPN does not require that a device be domain joined. When you migrate domain-joined devices that use DirectAccess, Always On VPN can provide a single, cohesive solution for remote access for all your connected devices going forward, even personally owned devices. Also, organizations can choose which management platform they prefer for deploying the Always On VPN configuration because the CSP is not vendor specific.

For additional details about the advantages of Always On VPN, see [Always On VPN and DirectAccess Features Comparison](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/vpn-map-da).

### Platform integration

Always On VPN has improved integration with the Windows operating system and third-party solutions to provide a robust platform for countless advanced connection scenarios. Microsoft has introduced or improved the following integration capabilities in Always On VPN:

| Key improvement | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| **[Windows Information Protection (WIP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/threat-protection/windows-information-protection/protect-enterprise-data-using-wip)** | Integration with WIP allows network policy enforcement to determine whether traffic is permitted to go over the VPN. If the user profile is active and WIP policies are applied, Always On VPN is automatically triggered to connect. Also, when you use WIP, there's no need to specify AppTriggerList and TrafficFilterList rules separately in the VPN profile (unless you want more advanced configuration) because the WIP policies and application lists automatically take effect. |
| **[Windows Hello for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/access-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview)** | Always On VPN natively supports Windows Hello for Business (in certificate-based authentication mode) to provide a seamless single sign-on experience for both sign-in to the machine and connection to the VPN. Therefore, no secondary authentication (user credentials) is needed for the VPN connection, making it possible to use an Always On connection with Windows Hello for Business authentication. |
| **[Microsoft Azure conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-controls)** | The Always On VPN client can integrate with the Azure conditional access platform to enforce multifactor authentication (MFA), device compliance, or a combination of the two. When compliant with conditional access policies, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) issues a short-lived (by default, 60 minutes) IP Security (IPsec) authentication certificate that can then be used to authenticate to the VPN gateway. Device compliance uses System Center Configuration Manager/Intune compliance policies, which can include the device health attestation state as part of the connection compliance check. |
| **Azure MFA** | When combined with Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) services and the Network Policy Server (NPS) extension for Azure MFA, VPN authentication can use strong MFA. |
| **Third-party VPN plug-in** | With the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), third-party VPN providers can create a single application for the full range of Windows 10 devices. The UWP provides a guaranteed core API layer across devices, eliminating the complexity of and problems often associated with writing kernel-level drivers. Currently, Windows 10 UWP VPN plug-ins exist for Pulse Secure, F5 Access, Check Point Capsule VPN, FortiClient, and SonicWall Mobile Connect; no doubt, others will appear in the future. |

### Security

VPNs create a pinhole connection in your network firewall. Securing that connection is important, especially when that connection is active most of the time. Always On VPN has new, advanced security capabilities to restrict the type of traffic, which applications can use the VPN connection, and which authentication methods you can use to initiate the connection. The primary improvements in security are in the following areas:

| Key improvement | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Traffic filters** | Through traffic filters, you can specify client-side policies that determine which traffic is allowed into the corporate network. In this way, administrators can apply app or traffic restrictions on the VPN interface, limiting its use to certain sources, destination ports, and IP addresses. Two types of filtering rules are available:<ul><li>**App-based rules.** App-based firewall rules are based on a list of specified applications so that only traffic originating from these apps are permitted to go over the VPN interface.</li><li>**Traffic-based rules.** Traffic-based firewall rules are based on network requirements like ports, addresses, and protocols. Use these rules to require that only traffic that matches these specific conditions are permitted to go over the VPN interface.</li></ul> |
| **LockDown VPN** | LockDown VPN secures the device to allow only network traffic over the VPN interface and provides a configuration option suitable for highly security-conscious organizations. |
| **Per-App VPN** | Per-App VPN is like having an app-based traffic filter, but it goes farther to combine application triggers with an app-based traffic filter so that VPN connectivity is constrained to a specific application as opposed to all applications on the VPN client. The feature is automatically initiated when the app starts. |
| **Support for customized IPsec cryptography algorithms** | Always On VPN supports the use of both RSA and elliptic curve cryptography–based custom cryptographic algorithms to meet stringent government or organizational security policies. |
| **Native Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) support** | Always On VPN natively supports EAP, which allows you to use a diverse set of Microsoft and third-party EAP types as part of the authentication workflow. EAP provides secure authentication based on the following authentication types:<ul><li>User name and password</li><li>Smart card (both physical and virtual)</li><li>User or machines certificates</li><li>Windows Hello for Business</li><li>One-time password (OTP) or MFA support by way of EAP RADIUS integration</li></ul>The application vendor controls third-party UWP VPN plug-in authentication methods, although they have an array of available options, including custom credential types and OTP support. |

###<a name="vpn-connectivity"></a> VPN connectivity

Windows 10 has improved connectivity options over previous versions of the Windows operating system. When comparing DirectAccess to Always On VPN in the past, this is where DirectAccess often stood out. Until Always On VPN in Windows 10, the ability to create a persistent connection through either user or device authentication was not possible. Now, using the Always On feature with or without Device Tunnel, you can easily configure a persistent connection by using user or device authentication.

With Always On VPN, the connection type does not have to be exclusively user or device but can be a combination of both. For example, you could enable device authentication for remote device management, and then enable user authentication for connectivity to internal company sites and services. The following are the primary improvements in Always On VPN connectivity:

| Key improvement | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Always On** | Always On is a Windows 10 feature that enables the active VPN profile to connect automatically and remain connected based on triggers—namely, user sign-in, network state change, or device screen active. Always On is also integrated into the connected standby experience to maximize battery life. |
| **Application triggering** | You can configure VPN profiles in Windows 10 to connect automatically on the launch of a specified set of applications. You can configure both desktop and UWP applications to trigger a VPN connection. |
| **Name-based triggering** | With Always On VPN, you can define rules so that specific domain name queries trigger the VPN connection. Windows 10 now supports name-based triggering for domain-joined and nondomain-joined machines (previously, only nondomain-joined machines were supported). |
| **Trusted network detection** | Always On VPN includes this feature to ensure that VPN connectivity is not triggered if a user is connected to a trusted network within the corporate boundary. You can combine this feature with any of the triggering methods mentioned earlier to provide a seamless "only connect when needed" user experience. |
| **[Device Tunnel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/vpn-device-tunnel-config)** | Always On VPN gives you the ability to create a dedicated VPN profile for device or machine. Unlike _User Tunnel_, which only connects after a user logs on to the device or machine, _Device Tunnel_ allows the VPN to establish connectivity before user sign-in. Additionally, Device Tunnel provides feature parity with the _Infrastructure Tunnel_ concept of DirectAccess. You can use traffic filters to control which corporate resources as available through the Device Tunnel and when machine certificate authentication is employed. Both Device Tunnel and User Tunnel operate independently with their VPN profiles, can be connected at the same time, and can use different authentication methods and other VPN configuration settings as appropriate. |

### Networking

Microsoft added advanced networking capabilities to Always On VPN to allow administrators to specify routing policies at a more granular level—even down to the individual application—which is perfect for line-of-business (LOB) apps that require special remote access. Always On VPN is also fully compatible with both Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and version 6 (IPv6). Unlike DirectAccess, there is no specific dependency on IPv6. The following are some of the networking improvements in Always On VPN:

| Key improvement | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Dual-stack support for IPv4 and IPv6** | Always On VPN natively supports the use of both IPv4 and IPv6 in a dual-stack approach. It has no specific dependency on one protocol over the other, which allows for maximum IPv4/IPv6 application compatibility combined with support for future IPv6 networking needs. |
| **Application-specific routing policies** | In addition to defining global VPN connection routing policies for internet and intranet traffic separation, it is possible to add routing policies to control the use of split tunnel or force tunnel configurations on a per-application basis. This option gives you more granular control over which apps are allowed to interact with which resources through the VPN tunnel. |
| **Exclusion routes** | Always On VPN supports the ability to specify exclusion routes that specifically control routing behavior to define which traffic should traverse the VPN only and not go over the physical network interface.<br><br>**Important.** Exclusion routes only work in a Split Tunnel setup. |

### Configuration and compatibility

You can deploy and manage Always On VPN in several ways, which gives Always On VPN several advantages over other VPN client software that may require advanced software packaging and deployment, end-user involvement in the configuration, or simply lack features like Always On or Device Tunnel. As long as the standard protocols and authentication mechanisms work with the additional gateways, you can use the features of Always On VPN without having to set up a Always On VPN server infrastructure. The following are some of the configuration and
compatibility improvements in Always On VPN:

| Key improvement | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Third-party VPN gateway compatibility** | The Always On VPN client does not require the use of a Microsoft-based VPN gateway to operate. Through the support of the IKEv2 protocol, the client facilitates interoperability with third-party VPN gateways that support this industry-standard tunneling type. Always On VPN also has backward-compatibility with Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol/IPsec, and Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol. You can also achieve interoperability with third-party VPN gateways by using a UWP VPN plug-in combined with a custom tunneling type without sacrificing Always On VPN platform features and benefits. |
| **Industry-standard IKEv2 VPN protocol support** | The Always On VPN client supports IKEv2, one of today's most widely used industry-standard tunneling protocols. This compatibility maximizes interoperability with third-party VPN gateways. |
| **Platform support** | Always On VPN supports domain-joined, nondomain-joined (workgroup), or Azure AD–joined devices to allow for both enterprise and bring your own device (BYOD) scenarios. Also, Always On VPN is available in all Windows editions. |
| **Diverse management and deployment mechanisms** | You can use many management and deployment mechanisms to manage VPN settings (called a *VPN profile*), including Windows PowerShell, System Center Configuration Manager, Intune (or third-party mobile device management [MDM] tool), and Windows Configuration Designer. These options simplify the configuration of Always On VPN regardless of the client management tools you use. |
| **Standardized VPN profile definition** | Always On VPN supports configuration using a standard XML profile (ProfileXML), providing a standard configuration template format that most management and deployment toolsets use. |
