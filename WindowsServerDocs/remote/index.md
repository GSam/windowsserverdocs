# Remote access and server management

>[!TIP]
> Looking for information about older versions of Windows Server? Check out our other [Windows Server libraries](/previous-versions/windows/) on docs.microsoft.com. You can also [search this site](https://docs.microsoft.com/search/index?search=Windows+Server&dataSource=previousVersions) for specific information.

## [Remote Desktop Services](remote-desktop-services/welcome-to-rds.md)
Remote Desktop Services enables users to access Windows-based programs that are installed on a Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) server, or to access the full Windows desktop. With Remote Desktop Services, users can access an RD Session Host server from within a corporate network or from the Internet.

## [Remote Access](remote-access/Remote-Access.md)

The Remote Access server role includes DirectAccess and virtual private network \(VPN\), local area network \(LAN\) Routing, and Web Application Proxy. RAS allows you to provide network connectivity to remote employees, site-to-site VPN to connect remote office locations over the Internet, and the RAS Gateway, which has multitenant and Border Gateway Protocol \(BGP\) capabilities for Enterprises and Cloud Service Providers \(CSPs\).

## [Web Application Proxy](remote-access/web-application-proxy/web-application-proxy-windows-server.md)

Web Application Proxy provides reverse proxy functionality for web applications inside your corporate network to allow users on any device to access them from outside the corporate network safely and securely.



## [Multipoint Services](multipoint-services/multipoint-services.md)

Use MultiPoint Services to enable multiple users, each with their own independent and familiar Windows experience, to simultaneously share one computer.


## [Remote Server Administration Tools](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt126174.aspx)

To ease remote server management, you can download and install Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10. Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10 includes Server Manager, Microsoft Management Console (mmc) snap-ins, consoles, Windows PowerShell cmdlets and providers, and some command-line tools for managing roles and features that run on Windows Server 2016.
